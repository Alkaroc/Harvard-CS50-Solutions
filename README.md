# Harvard CS50s Solutions
Solutions to [Harvard's CS50 course, taken through edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).

I currently have very slow internet (200-400 kbps), so am unable to use either cs50.io or download the offline version. For this reason I build and test my answers without using my own test cases. 

I then add the extra code to make them conform to CS50 (i.e. include <cs50.h> and use 'get_string()'), but this step is currently untested.
